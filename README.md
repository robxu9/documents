# Documents

Sometimes I have a random set of documents that I keep up for one reason or another. It could be a resume, ramblings about what I'm doing, or things I'm currently interested in. Often times documents might be one thing or another. Who knows?

Anyway, there's that.

### Aside:

Just because I don't know what'll be up here, I've licensed everything in this repository under a Creative Commons License. If I end up making one of these ideas, I'll probably relicense it to the MIT license or something similar. (When I do, the document will be explicitly marked with a license, and that license overrules the one below.)
